Starting with Windows 98 other version of solitaire joined the suit - FreeCell, Spider, Tri-Peaks and Pyramid. As a part of the standard Windows installation those games have been popularized around the world. For each of those games millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We combined all six games (Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Tri-Peaks and two flavors of Pyramid) in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe fun of original games is preserved but some improvement are made to make it easier to play on the small factor devices. In particular, you don't have to drag individual cards - drag&drop whole column, only proper cards will move the rest will snap back. The scoring all the games is simplified to track only number of moves to solve the puzzle. If you stuck, feel free to use hints or undo - implemented by all the games. Use menu (top-tight corner) to change the game type, difficulty, check score, help or to start a new game.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to check our Game section for other fun games...","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDM8T0","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Sudoku+","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15972.9007199266445553.44bc064a-a07e-4282-8858-4aa3d991335a.31fa1990-6745-4700-af92-7cfb3fd611c6","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#0099d2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63850.9007199266445553.7582f6ba-de09-41fb-8701-d347e2f44796.cf46def0-be8f-4fbf-b166-f0b02eec62c7","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#0099d2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41699.9007199266445553.2a2775f5-1e6c-4f65-ac56-fd1e1c565369.35fb2baa-c342-469e-ad0a-52a2e525ee5f","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#0099d2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62272.9007199266445553.7517ff71-f77f-44d8-bc2c-d940d270f659.1157cfe2-7e02-42f6-aee0-0468a9a783b3","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#0099d2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42064.9007199266445553.7af1fb5f-348b-4c28-ba63-c8b996576ab7.dba714fb-f781-4f1e-bdcd-697ac7248833","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#0099d2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15775.9007199266445553.fca28684-c091-4741-b610-9477d3229476.9c9e7974-e117-4e39-a16b-0cb52a3425bd","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#0099d2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52930.9007199266445553.ccbea651-beef-4383-9bac-2bf32f83f5c2.a4360dd8-f11e-4d9b-a120-ee19ef144ea2","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#0099d2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["56963Oxozle.HD_g8mgcn8w2fxt6"],"ContentIds":["a95baa30-e4f8-3ede-1219-f2800fed5ca7","a720f09e-1d03-2c77-e49f-719387427ef3"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Popular puzzle with numbers.

Carrom is a similar to Billiards or Table Shuffleboard game however instead of pool cues you use your fingers.\r\n\r\nThe object of the game is to flick a striker to hit and pocket a playing coin. The coins can be pocketed into any pocket.\r\n\r\nAs there are a huge number of variations in the rules exists so this App 'tries' to support 2 types of popular Carrom game play i.e. 'Family-Point' and 'Professional' and implements only those Carrom rules which I found practical to implement.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n1. App does not allowed to strike backward from carrom-stricker baseline.\r\n2. Due to scoring rules in 'Professional' game play mode, scoring can only be possible after current round is over.\r\n3. Player sides does not change during the game rather first player breaks first for odd (e.g. 1, 3 ...) number rounds and second player breaks first in even (e.g. 2, 4 ...) number rounds.\r\n4.

Kingdoms is about forging alliances, political mind games, city-building and castle sieges with thousands of other players. Cast as a feudal lord or lady, players begin with a single village and keep. They must design and defend their castle before turning their eye to the rest of the country, Europe and the world! Whatever path they choose players will find strength in numbers as they band together, uniting with local Factions and player-led Houses.\r\n\r\nBesiege the castle that’s never been taken, overthrow ruthless tyrants, bankroll your faction’s war efforts, pillage your neighbor’s resources, peacefully raise cattle or do it all! Factions, elections, liege lords and their vassals come together to form a feudal community of real players with whom to discuss strategies and build allegiances.\r\n \r\nWhile an impregnable castle should be at the heart of any kingdom, you can also specialize with a vast research tree. Starting as a humble peasant each promotion provides valuable research points to spend on trading, diplomacy, warfare, farming or religion. Beware as your power grows so does your responsibility. Your vassals will look to you for leadership and you may find yourself fighting for the crown

If kid is interested more in some types of games, he/she can skip the ones he/she doesn't want.\r\n\r\nTo keep kids challenged, points are awarded for each game stage completed. A scoreboard is maintained which kid can see after each game. When kid scores enough points, he/she earns a sticker of his/her choice. All his/her earned stickers are kept in a box which he/she can relish any time they want later.\r\n\r\nWe have put our every effort to make this app interesting and beautiful.

of city building and tower defense awesomeness!\r\n\r\nUNIQUE SIMULATION + STRATEGY GAMING\r\nTake back the wilderness from the invading bloon hordes and pop your way from a modest settlement to a thriving metropolis. Attack bloon-infested territory adjacent to your city, win a short tower defense game, and add the captured territory to your city as a space on which to build. Buildings are the heart of your city, and each one has a specific purpose - individual monkey towers for battle, upgrades for those towers, farms and banks to drive your economy, power to supercharge your city, epic buildings for epic powers, and decorations to make your city more awesome. Every time you build, your city looks cooler, you increase your power potential in tower defense play, and you open up even more rewards and challenges.\r\n\r\nAMAZING DEPTH AND VARIETY\r\nAll 21 of the fully awesomized and carefully balanced Bloons TD 5 towers are available within Monkey City, with completely new unlock mechanics. More than 130 buildings and decorations give you endless strategies and city design options. Explore the wilderness to find treasure tiles and uncover 11 powerful special items like the Banana Replicator and the Dark Temple Idol. Burst bloons on 55 all new tower defense maps or test your mastery on 13 wildly challenging original special missions. Either way, be ready to encounter all new bloon waves and special bloon attack patterns like Cash Starve or Fast and Furious.\r\n\r\nREINFORCE YOUR FRIENDS\r\nConnect with Facebook friends, then help each other win and expand. Send Supply Crates back and forth for bonus starting cash. Visit friends' cities to check out their strategies and their city design skills, and while you're there root out any bloon spies to win a reward for both you and your friend.\r\n\r\nSHOW OFF YOUR SKILLS\r\nBuild up the strongest lineup of monkey towers possible and compete with other players for the best score in weekly Contested Territory events. Use the latest in monkey science to send player vs. player bloon attacks, then see whose defenses are the strongest and earn extra rewards for victory.\r\n\r\nDownload for free and play Bloons Monkey City now!\r\n\r\nPlease Note:\r\nBloons Monkey City is free to download and play (aside from internet, carrier, data, device, and other services for which the player is financially responsible), but some in-game items can be purchased with real money.

It is one of the best known board games of all-time.\r\n\r\nThe classic fast-trading property game features tokens from the 1930s all the way to the 2000s, with a beautiful game board and cards, the game takes you back to when it all began, but you still have to build your houses and hotels and see if you can bankrupt everyone else. The jet-set gameplay will be epic as you race around the world to visit the world’s most exciting places and buy locations.\r\n\r\nOnopoly is also known popularly called Business Board Game, The Landlord's Game and Finance\r\n\r\nOnopoly is a great game for 2 - 6 players. It is a board game where players roll two six-sided dice to move around the game board, buying and trading properties, and develop them with houses and hotels. Players collect rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them into bankruptcy. \r\n\r\nMoney can also be gained or lost through Chance and Community Chest cards, and tax squares; players can end up in jail, which they cannot move from until they have met one of several conditions. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.\r\n\r\nPlay against the computer, against your friends in Local mode or with Thousands of Onopoly players around the world in Online Multiplayer Mode.\r\n\r\nYou can also create Private Rooms and invite your friends to play in Play with Friends Mode.\r\n\r\nOnopoly is a simple game: you start off with some money, and your goal is to be the last player standing with money. The way you win in Monopoly is by collecting rents on property, or cash flow.\r\n\r\nOnopoly brilliantly combines both strategy and chance.

exciting adventure of a brave girl who found herself in a fantasy world. She has to find a way to stop the cursed beasts awakened after sleeping for a thousand years and coming to life for reasons unknown.\r\n\r\nTRY THE FREE TRIAL VERSION, AND THEN UNLOCK THE COMPLETE ADVENTURE IN THE GAME!\r\n\r\nLost Lands: the Golden Curse is an adventurous hidden object game-quest with puzzles and mini-games scattered through the boundless spaces of the fantasy world – from the volcano valleys to the Druid forest, from the deep caves to the floating islands.\r\n\r\nOne fine day an ordinary good-looking housewife, Susan, while visiting the museum of arts drops by an old looking glass which, for whatever reason, starts to beckon her up. When she touched the looking-glass, Susan was immediately transported into a magical fantasy world of the Lost Lands. She has been known for her heroic deeds as Susan the Warrior there.\r\nSusan meets a child named Fiora, and the girl takes Susan to her great-grandfather, Maaron.

The child is given three digits and two operators and has to compose the case him/herself.\r\nWhat’s so special about it? The child visually memorizes the case itself and can see what will happen if he changes the digits. Now there is no need to scissor out paper digits. The program itself indicates whether or not your child has composed the case right.\r\n \r\n“Training” is an easy-to-handle tool for effective instruction of your child. Forget about countless slips of paper with cases written on them! Everything is right here: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. After solving the problem the results are saved and can be seen on the stats page, the graph represents the results and the number of errors. This helps to track the dynamics of learning.\r\n \r\nOnce your child has learnt to solve the cases, you won’t have to study with him. After the solving you will always be able to see the way he or she has solved it.\r\n \r\nToday there is no app with similar functionality.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDLZ0N","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Spider (Free)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31670.9007199266438783.608d1e9f-946a-475c-8fa3-fb013108b76f.d1a00048-bf4e-4380-b822-47b4f734b416","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12759.9007199266438783.76a8d8d5-0839-40d7-afb8-c18936974284.c1e10216-8b84-4a70-a801-e9c6f03ab92a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["GASPMobileGamesInc.SpiderFree_9haz0p453120e"],"ContentIds":["36c317a0-65c4-4f2d-0019-1053e835a3a3","9316fd81-8525-e96a-d197-14cf6648a3fd"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The most popular version of Spider Solitaire was introduced in Windows 98. The aim of the game is to get all of the cards in order (King to Ace). To win, you must remove all the cards from the table by building columns organized in descending order, from king to ace. At intermediate (2-suits) and advanced (4-suites) levels, the cards must also match suit. When you succeed in building a sequentially-ordered column, it flies off the table. If you run out of moves, click the pile at the bottom of the table to deal a new row of cards. \r\n\r\nIn our version we largely tried to recreate a full experience of that version in a tiny download package, along with multiple suite versions of the game, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ2SM","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Classic Solitaire (Free)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41687.9007199266246012.874ed23e-cbcb-48e3-8e84-29257adf5226.1a8de7f4-ee66-4e57-813b-cd84929d1a45","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19041.9007199266246012.874ed23e-cbcb-48e3-8e84-29257adf5226.4da23999-1770-4d33-8720-ade06afa2fa1","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20863.9007199266246012.874ed23e-cbcb-48e3-8e84-29257adf5226.c8d01825-fbf2-4760-9884-a5fea7269a95","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["470AlexeiGarbuzenko.ClassicSolitaireFree_gd2qghq4jdjcm"],"ContentIds":["7420aa68-246b-8f95-630e-2283ae1ef1ff","475e5ff9-89be-a6fe-1054-33ebc1030502","d5204502-f5f8-59b5-f832-bb031e44d5ba","bbdc6f04-fb0d-3ecb-e8b7-e88a38ce90c9"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Old good Solitaire implementation for retro lovers!

mindblowing bike racing action set in a huge urban sprawl called The City. Separated into a set of districts, each with its own look and real feel. Prepare for heart-stopping and breathtaking thrills you have never seen in mobile games before.\r\n\r\nRIDE EPIC BIKES\r\nRace on a huge selection of easily customizable motorcycles ranging from badass choppers to fast motocross bikes. All prepped up, loaded with nitro and ready to unleash their full fury on the asphalt below.\r\nThere’s also a treat for all of the dirt fanatics out there - you can drive real quads.

They believe that all of the best things in the world are for free (when you take them forcibly) and that having fun in life is the only thing that matters. Except for power and money, of course.\r\n\r\nEXPRESS YOURSELF\r\nCustomize your bike with unique tuning - slap some decals and paint it with your favourite color. Go crazy with the combinations, it’s your ride - your rules. In illegal drag racing competitions being creative about your bike is the only way to become known and respected.\r\n\r\nEXPLORE THE URBAN SPRAWL\r\nThe City is split into districts, each run by a different bike gang. You’ll have to beat all of the renegade bikers if you hope to assume direct control over The City. Race in a deep selection of realistic game modes and challenges.\r\n\r\nBECOME A LEGEND OF THE ROAD\r\nThe great highway awaits for those brave enough to compete with the best racing competitors in the world of underground bike community.
