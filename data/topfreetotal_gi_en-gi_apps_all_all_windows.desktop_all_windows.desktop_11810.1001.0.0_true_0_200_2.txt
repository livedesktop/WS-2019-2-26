But it this was war, and the law of a good soldier was a lack of feeling. Numbing my emotions and attachments to the people and places I visited was a challenge, but I soon realized the benefit... because now I was unstoppable.\r\n\r\n**** INTENSE GAME PLAY **** \r\nLaunch a fun, fast-paced 3D mobile gaming experience upon downloading this addictive FPS game.

However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nPlay LUDO KING, Ludo with Friends NOW for FREE!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PFH14RQV52C","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Express Burn CD and DVD Burner Free","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5820.14204958300330860.809e4128-7fb8-41b8-b417-717c36308e32.e8f53f35-2541-464f-9d5e-33792d158591","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57462.14204958300330860.809e4128-7fb8-41b8-b417-717c36308e32.e85034e4-03f3-4696-982f-fdccd17170d5","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["NCHSoftware.ExpressBurnFree_7kedsbyvzns34"],"ContentIds":["ad281f3a-39e7-ca9a-0864-a3dee8eda8b1"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Express Burn is a burning suite program to create and record discs quickly and easily.

The program itself indicates whether or not your child has composed the case right.\r\n \r\n“Training” is an easy-to-handle tool for effective instruction of your child. Forget about countless slips of paper with cases written on them! Everything is right here: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. After solving the problem the results are saved and can be seen on the stats page, the graph represents the results and the number of errors. This helps to track the dynamics of learning.\r\n \r\nOnce your child has learnt to solve the cases, you won’t have to study with him.

An early variant of Tic-tac-toe was played in Roman Empire, around the first century BC. It was called Terni Lapilli and instead of having any number of pieces, each player only had three, thus they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing. The game's grid markings have been found chalked all over Rome. However, there is some evidence to suggest that Tic-Tac-Toe could originate back to ancient Egypt. \r\nThe different names of the game are more recent. The first print reference to \"noughts and crosses\", the British name, appeared in 1864. The first print reference to a game called \"tick-tack-toe\" occurred in 1884, but referred to \"a children's game played on a slate, consisting in trying with the eyes shut to bring the pencil down on one of the numbers of a set, the number hit being scored\". \"Tic-tac-toe\" may also derive from \"tick-tack\", the name of an old version of backgammon first described in 1558. The U.S. renaming of noughts and crosses as tic-tac-toe occurred in the 20th century. \r\nWhen playing against a phone, human player is always 'O'. The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. Using menu button, game can be configured to play on the larger boards to connect 4 pieces, or between 2 people.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

10!\r\n\r\nSolitaire remains the most played computer game of all time, and for good reason. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day. Complete enough Daily Challenges in a month to earn badges and compete with your friends.\r\n\r\nStar Club\r\nEven more challenges arranged in collections and packs you can unlock by earning stars.\r\n\r\nChoose Your Theme\r\nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection features several beautiful themes, from the simplicity of \"Classic\" to the serenity of an Aquarium that comes to life before you while you play. You can even create custom themes from your own photos!\r\n\r\nXbox Live Integration\r\nSign in with your Microsoft account to earn achievements, compete with your friends on the leaderboards, and track your personal gameplay statistics. If you sign in with a Microsoft account, your progress is stored in the cloud so you can play the game on any device without missing a beat!\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRCX2KG","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"KakaoTalk","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13140.9007199267046819.31812a2f-4d34-4e10-bad6-69efd751f0b8.8fdef226-1192-4142-9c2c-e9f47a3a8cb5","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#FAE100","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35765.9007199267046819.31812a2f-4d34-4e10-bad6-69efd751f0b8.0aafecf9-f1c5-4775-8f51-06bd237377fd","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#FAE100","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42064.9007199267046819.31812a2f-4d34-4e10-bad6-69efd751f0b8.192ddea0-b88c-40f3-a5eb-2c88a16907fa","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FAE100","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30726.9007199267046819.31812a2f-4d34-4e10-bad6-69efd751f0b8.b66c6578-d417-4c63-9c3e-577e79046fff","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FAE100","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62503.9007199267046819.31812a2f-4d34-4e10-bad6-69efd751f0b8.cb15a883-65c0-444e-8840-8da746ebc24c","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#FAE100","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51409.9007199267046819.31812a2f-4d34-4e10-bad6-69efd751f0b8.bc904335-a039-47ff-8c19-8e8cbf07eab0","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FAE100","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18591.9007199267046819.31812a2f-4d34-4e10-bad6-69efd751f0b8.e1d29f27-80ce-47d5-a0b0-2f8011b3c100","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FAE100","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7203.9007199267046819.31812a2f-4d34-4e10-bad6-69efd751f0b8.b8241120-096c-458d-83ee-382fb4bc88d5","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#FAE100","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60832.9007199267046819.31812a2f-4d34-4e10-bad6-69efd751f0b8.ef25d918-db10-422b-bb91-cc973f0b6e67","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FAE100","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22266.9007199267046819.2a16e131-ea66-4c10-859e-caf07be444b5.7ef7d4c3-17a9-448f-9af0-c93e96c01beb","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FAE100","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["1CB77C17.17884BE984322_th66h09paefv0"],"ContentIds":["c5da4e4e-2c65-d787-0086-8c8d17c70ee9","3154c17a-d626-bf3e-9b8e-1c06e4686545"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"KakaoTalk is an easy, no-cost messenger that transcends standard chat. \r\nEnjoy the KakaoTalk beta version for Microsoft Store!\r\n\r\nFeatures of KakaoTalk (Beta)\r\n* Free Chat\r\nFriends all over the world are never far from reach with KakaoTalk.

In short, it is an app that I now cannot imagine being without, and the only time I've experienced something that betters pen and paper.” - Ewen Miller, head of Calderpeel Architects\n\n- “I use it just for everything.
